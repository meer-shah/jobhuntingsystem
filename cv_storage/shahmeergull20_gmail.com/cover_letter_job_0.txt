My experience in building GPT-based chatbots for SaaS, real estate, and e-commerce using LangChain and ChromaDB, as well as creating cold email generators and document summarization systems, demonstrates my ability to design and deploy ML pipelines on GCP.

I am particularly drawn to this role because of the opportunity to work with Graph Neural Networks and deploy ML pipelines on GCP. I am confident that my problem-solving skills, combined with my client-facing experience, make me an ideal fit for this position.

I would appreciate the chance to discuss how my skills can benefit your organization. Please feel free to contact me at shahmeergull20@gmail.com or +92-311-7433413.
